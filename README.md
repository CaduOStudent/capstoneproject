## üìö capstoneProject

This project aims to build a robust and scalable Book Catalog API using Python and FastAPI. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on a collection of books, supports bulk creation, and is designed with modern DevOps practices including containerization, CI/CD, and orchestration via Kubernetes and Helm.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Book Catalog API provides endpoints to:

- Add individual or multiple books
- Retrieve one or all books
- Update book details
- Delete books

It‚Äôs built using:

- **FastAPI** for high-performance web APIs
- **PostgreSQL** as the database backend
- **Docker** for containerization
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Kubernetes** and **Helm** for deployment and orchestration

## üîß API Usage Examples

### Add a New Book

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8000/api/books/ -d '{
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "isbn": "9780061120084",
  "published_date": "1960-07-11"
}'
```

### Bulk Add Books

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8000/api/books/bulk-create/ -d '[{...}, {...}]'
```

### Delete a Book

```bash
curl -X DELETE localhost:8000/api/books/1/
```

### Get a Specific Book

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/books/{id}/ | jq
```

### Get All Books

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/books/ | jq
```

### Edit a Book

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH localhost:8000/api/books/7/ -d '{"title":"Dracula from Barm"}'

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (local or containerized)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capstoneProject.git
cd capstoneProject
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables (e.g. in `.env`):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/bookcatalog
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

The CI/CD pipeline is configured using **GitHub Actions** and includes:

- **Linting and formatting** checks with `black` and `flake8`
- **Unit tests** using `pytest`
- **Docker image build** and push to Docker Hub
- **Deployment to Kubernetes** using Helm

Workflow triggers:

- On every push to `main` or pull request
- On tag creation for production releases

## ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes and Helm Setup Instructions

### Helm Chart Structure

```bash
helm/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ingress.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ values.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chart.yaml
```

### Deploy to Kubernetes

1. Package the Helm chart:

```bash
helm package helm/
```

2. Install the chart:

```bash
helm install bookcatalog ./bookcatalog-0.1.0.tgz
```

3. Update values if needed:

```bash
helm upgrade bookcatalog ./bookcatalog-0.1.0.tgz --values helm/values.yaml
```

4. Check deployment status:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```
